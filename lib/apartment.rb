### `Apartment`
has a number, rent, square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms
#B-Instance variables
has many tenants
#B-Apartment requires tenant
the list of tenants should not be modified directly (bonus: actually prevent it from being modified directly)
#B-Private? At very least, not attr_accessor
has a method to add a tenant that raises an error if the tenant has a "bad" credit rating, or if the new tenant count would go over the number of bedrooms
has a method to remove a specific tenant either by object reference *or* by name (bonus: do this without checking classes), which raises an error if the tenant is not found
has a method that removes all tenants
has an average credit score, calculated from all tenants
has a credit rating, calculated from the average credit score using the logic below
